- The Maximum Entropy Toolkit provides a set of tools and library for constructing maximum entropy (maxent) model in either Python or C++.
Maxent Entropy Model is a general purpose machine learning framework that has proved to be highly expressive and powerful in statistical natural language processing, statistical physics, computer vision and many other fields.

- A whole slew of example machine learning algorithms from the book
"Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective" by Stephen Marsland.
All code is written in python.

maybe, not sure what section

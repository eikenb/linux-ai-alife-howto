      CASE (Cellular Automaton Simulation Environment) is a C++
      toolkit for visualizing discrete models in two dimensions:
      so-called cellular automata. The aim of this project is to

      The CLEARS system is an interactive graphical environment for
      computational semantics. The tool allows exploration and
      comparison of different semantic formalisms, and their
      interaction with syntax. This enables the user to get an idea of
      the range of possibilities of semantic construction, and also
      where there is real convergence between theories.

	IDEAL is a test bed for work in influence diagrams and
	Bayesian networks. It contains various inference algorithms
	for belief networks and evaluation algorithms for influence
	diagrams. It contains facilities for creating and editing
	influence diagrams and belief networks.

	IDEAL is written in pure Common Lisp and so it will run in
	Common Lisp on any platform. The emphasis in writing IDEAL has
	been on code clarity and providing high level programming
	abstractions. It thus is very suitable for experimental
	implementations which need or extend belief network
	technology.

	At the highest level, IDEAL can be used as a subroutine
	library which provides belief network inference and influence
	diagram evaluation as a package. The code is documented in a
	detailed manual and so it is also possible to work at a lower
	level on extensions of belief network methods.
 
	IDEAL comes with an optional graphic interface written in
	CLIM. If your Common Lisp also has CLIM, you can run the
	graphic interface.

        QUANT/1 stands for type QUANTifier. It aims to be an alternative to
        Prolog-like (Resulutional-like) systems. Main features include a lack
        of necessity for eliminating Quantifiers, scolemisation, ease of
        comprehension, large scale formulae operation, acceptance of nonHorn
        formulaes, and Iterative deeping. The actual library implemented in
        this project is called ATPPCF (Automatic Theorem Prover in calculus of
        Positively Constructed Formulae).

        ATPPCF will be a library (inference engine) and an extension of the
        Predicate Calculus Language as a new logical language. The library will
        be incorporable in another software such as TCL, Python, Perl. The
        engine's primary inference method will be the "search of inference in
        language of Positively Constructed Formulas (PCFs)" (a subset of
        Predicate Calculus well translated in both directions). The language
        will be used as scripting language to the engine. But there will be
        possibility to replace it with extensions languages of main software.

      This program simulates primitive life-forms, equipped with some
      basic instincts and abilities, in a 2D environment consisting of
      cells.  By mutation new generations can prove their success, and thus
      passing on "good family values".

      The brain of a TIN can be seen as a collection of processes, each
      representing drives or impulses to behave a certain way, depending on the
      state/perception of the environment ( e.g. presence of food, walls,
      neighbors, scent traces) These behavior process currently are : eating,
      moving, mating, relaxing, tracing others, gathering food and killing. The
      process with the highest impulse value takes control, or in other words:
      the tin will act according to its most urgent need.

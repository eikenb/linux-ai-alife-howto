<sect>Connectionism
<label id="Connectionism">
<p>
        Connectionism is a technical term for a group of related
        techniques. These techniques include areas such as Artificial
        Neural Networks, Semantic Networks and a few other similar
        ideas. My present focus is on neural networks (though I am
        looking for resources on the other techniques). Neural
        networks are programs designed to simulate the workings of the
        brain. They consist of a network of small mathematical-based
        nodes, which work together to form patterns of information.
        They have tremendous potential and currently seem to be having
        a great deal of success with image processing and robot
        control.


    <sect1>Connectionist class/code libraries
<p>

    These are libraries of code or classes for use in programming within
    the Connectionist field.  They are not meant as stand alone
    applications, but rather as tools for building your own applications.

      This software implements flexible Bayesian models for regression
      and classification applications that are based on multilayer
      perceptron neural networks or on Gaussian processes.  The
      implementation uses Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.  Software
      modules that support Markov chain sampling are included in the
      distribution, and may be useful in other applications.

      BELIEF is a Common Lisp implementation of the Dempster and Kong
      fusion and propagation algorithm for Graphical Belief Function
      Models and the Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter algorithm for
      Graphical Probabilistic Models. It includes code for
      manipulating graphical belief models such as Bayes Nets and
      Relevance Diagrams (a subset of Influence Diagrams) using both
      belief functions and probabilities as basic representations of
      uncertainty. It uses the Shenoy and Shafer version of the
      algorithm, so one of its unique features is that it supports
      both probability distributions and belief functions.  It also
      has limited support for second order models (probability
      distributions on parameters).

        Many neuroevolution methods evolve fixed-topology networks. Some
        methods evolve topologies in addition to weights, but these usually
        have a bound on the complexity of networks that can be evolved and
        begin evolution with random topologies. This project is based on a
        neuroevolution method called NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies
        (NEAT) that can evolve networks of unbounded complexity from a minimal
        starting point.

        The research as a broader goal of showing that evolving topologies is
        necessary to achieve 3 major goals of neuroevolution: (1) Continual
        coevolution: Successful competitive coevolution can use the evolution
        of topologies to continuously elaborate strategies. (2) Evolution of
        Adaptive Networks: The evolution of topologies allows neuroevolution to
        evolve adaptive networks with plastic synapses by designating which
        connections should be adaptive and in what ways. (3) Combining Expert
        Networks: Separate expert neural networks can be fused through the
        evolution of connecting neurons between them.

      GENESIS (short for GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a
      general purpose simulation platform which was developed to
      support the simulation of neural systems ranging from complex
      models of single neurons to simulations of large networks made
      up of more abstract neuronal components. GENESIS has provided
      the basis for laboratory courses in neural simulation at both
      Caltech and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA,
      as well as several other institutions. Most current GENESIS
      applications involve realistic simulations of biological neural
      systems. Although the software can also model more abstract
      networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation
      and similar connectionist modeling.

      The Neural Network Generator is a genetic algorithm for the
      topological optimization of feedforward neural networks. It
      implements the Semantic Changing Genetic Algorithm and the
      Unit-Cluster Model. The Semantic Changing Genetic Algorithm is
      an extended genetic algorithm that allows fast dynamic
      adaptation of the genetic coding through population
      analysis. The Unit-Cluster Model is an approach to the
      construction of modular feedforward networks with a ''backbone''
      structure.

      NOTE: To compile this on Linux requires one change in the Makefiles.
      You will need to change '-ltermlib' to '-ltermcap'.

      nn is a high-level neural network specification language. The
      current version is best suited for feed-forward nets, but
      recurrent models can and have been implemented, e.g. Hopfield
      nets, Jordan/Elman nets, etc.  In nn, it is easy to change
      network dynamics. The nn compiler can generate C code or
      executable programs (so there must be a C compiler available),
      with a powerful command line interface (but everything may also
      be controlled via the graphical interface, xnn). It is possible
      for the user to write C routines that can be called from inside
      the nn specification, and to use the nn specification as a
      function that is called from a C program. Please note that no
      programming is necessary in order to use the network models that
      come with the system (`netpack').

      xnn is a graphical front end to networks generated by the nn
      compiler, and to the compiler itself. The xnn graphical
      interface is intuitive and easy to use for beginners, yet
      powerful, with many possibilities for visualizing network data.

      NOTE: You have to run the install program that comes with this
      to get the license key installed. It gets put (by default) in
      /usr/lib. If you (like myself) want to install the package
      somewhere other than in the /usr directory structure (the
      install program gives you this option) you will have to set up
      some environmental variables (NNLIBDIR & NNINCLUDEDIR are
      required). You can read about these (and a few other optional
      variables) in appendix A of the documentation (pg 113).

      NEURON is an extensible nerve modeling and simulation
      program. It allows you to create complex nerve models by
      connecting multiple one-dimensional sections together to form
      arbitrary cell morphologies, and allows you to insert multiple
      membrane properties into these sections (including channels,
      synapses, ionic concentrations, and counters). The interface was
      designed to present the neural modeler with a intuitive
      environment and hide the details of the numerical methods used
      in the simulation.

      As the field of Connectionist modeling has grown, so has the need
      for a comprehensive simulation environment for the development and
      testing of Connectionist models. Our goal in developing PDP++ has been
      to integrate several powerful software development and user interface
      tools into a general purpose simulation environment that is both user
      friendly and user extensible. The simulator is built in the C++
      programming language, and incorporates a state of the art script
      interpreter with the full expressive power of C++. The graphical user
      interface is built with the Interviews toolkit, and allows full access
      to the data structures and processing modules out of which the
      simulator is built. We have constructed several useful graphical
      modules for easy interaction with the structure and the contents of
      neural networks, and we've made it possible to change and adapt many
      things. At the programming level, we have set things up in such a way
      as to make user extensions as painless as possible. The programmer
      creates new C++ objects, which might be new kinds of units or new
      kinds of processes; once compiled and linked into the simulator, these
      new objects can then be accessed and used like any other.

      The semnet.py module defines several simple classes for
      building and using semantic networks.  A semantic network is a
      way of representing knowledge, and it enables the program to
      do simple reasoning with very little effort on the part of the
      programmer.

      The following classes are defined:
      <itemize>
        <item><bf>Entity</bf>: This class represents a noun; it is
	        something which can be related to other things, and about
	        which you can store facts.
	    <item><bf>Relation</bf>: A Relation is a type of relationship
	        which may exist between two entities.  One special relation,
	        "IS&lowbar;A", is predefined because it has special meaning (a sort
	        of logical inheritance).
	    <item><bf>Fact</bf>: A Fact is an assertion that a relationship
	        exists between two entities.
      </itemize>
      <p>

      With these three object types, you can very quickly define knowledge
      about a set of objects, and query them for logical conclusions.

      Stuttgart Neural Net Simulator (version 4.1).  An awesome neural
      net simulator. Better than any commercial simulator I've seen. The
      simulator kernel is written in C (it's fast!). It supports over 20
      different network architectures, has 2D and 3D X-based graphical
      representations, the 2D GUI has an integrated network editor, and can
      generate a separate NN program in C. SNNS is very powerful, though
      a bit difficult to learn at first. To help with this it comes with
      example networks and tutorials for many of the architectures.

      classifiers. It consist of a library of functions (written in C)
      that can be called from your own program. Most of the well-known
      classifiers are present (k-nn, Fisher, Parzen, ....), as well as
      error estimation and dataset generation routines.

      ANNLIB (Artificial Neural Networks Library) is a neural network
      simulation library based on the data architecture laid down by
      SPRLIB. The library contains numerous functions for creating,
      training and testing feed-forward networks.  Training algorithms
      include back-propagation, pseudo-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt,
      conjugate gradient descent, BFGS.... Furthermore, it is possible
      - due to the datastructures' general applicability - to build
      Kohonen maps and other more exotic network architectures using
      the same data types.

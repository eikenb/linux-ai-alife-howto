<sect1>Purpose
<p>

The GNU/Linux OS has evolved from its origins in hackerdom to a full
blown UNIX, capable of rivaling any commercial UNIX.  It now provides
an inexpensive base to build a great workstation.  It has shed its
hardware dependencies, having been ported to DEC Alphas, Sparcs,
PowerPCs, and many others.  This potential speed boost along with its
networking support will make it great for workstation clusters.  As a
workstation it allows for all sorts of research and development,
including artificial intelligence and artificial life.


The purpose of this Howto is to provide a source to find out
about various software packages, code libraries, and anything else
that will help someone get started working with (and find resources
for) artificial intelligence, artificial life, etc.  All done with
GNU/Linux specifically in mind.

    <p>New entries: <ref id="SimpleAI">.

    <p>Resurfaced MIA entry: <ref id="NuPIC">.

    <p>Deleted the section on "Programming languages". I moved the couple of
    agent-oriented domain specific languages, <ref id="2APL"> and <ref
    id="APRIL">, into the sections relevant to the work. I removed the rest as
    they were all just general purpose languages.

    enough to pull out of the dead projects area and place back amounst the
    living. I also fixed many links and moved quite a few dead projects to

    <p>I chopped the Agents section into two sub-sections, one for <ref
    id="Software Agents"> and one for <ref id="Robotics and Simulators">. I
    play it a bit fast and loose in my deciding what goes into each category,
    but it is an improvement.

    <p>MIA found! <ref id="Cellular"> the cellular automata programming system.
    Fixed many bad links and cleaned out missing projects.

    groups into subsections entries with bad links that I can't find
    replacements for and long dead projects.

    section of the master site for them.
</itemize>

<sect1>Where to find this software
<p>

All this software should be available via the net (ftp || http).  The
links to where to find it will be provided in the description of each
package.  There will also be plenty of software not covered on these
pages (which is usually platform independent) located on one of the
resources listed on the <htmlurl url="http://zhar.net/howto/ai_links/"
name="links section"> of the Master Site (given above).


<sect1>Updates and comments
<p>

If you find any mistakes, know of updates to one of the items below,
or have problems compiling any of the applications, please mail me at:
<htmlurl url="mailto:jae@zhar.net" name="jae@zhar.net">
and I'll see what I can do.


If you know of any AI/Alife applications, class libraries,
etc. <bf>Please</bf> <htmlurl url="mailto:jae@zhar.net" name=" email me">
about them. Include your name, ftp and/or http sites where they can be
found, plus a brief overview/commentary on the software (this info
would make things a lot easier on me... but don't feel obligated ;).


I know that keeping this list up to date and expanding it will take quite
a bit of work. So please be patient (I do have other projects). I hope you
will find this document helpful.

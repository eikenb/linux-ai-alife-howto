      All about getting machines to learn to do something rather than 
      explicitly programming to do it. Tends to deal with pattern matching
      a lot and are heavily math and statistically based. Technically 
      <ref id="Connectionism"> falls under this category, but it is such a
      large sub-field I'm keeping it in a separate section.


  <sect1>Libraries

	CompLearn is a software system built to support compression-based
	learning in a wide variety of applications. It provides this support in
	the form of a library written in highly portable ANSI C that runs in
	most modern computer environments with minimal confusion. It also
	supplies a small suite of simple, composable command-line utilities as
	simple applications that use this library. Together with other commonly
	used machine-learning tools such as LibSVM and GraphViz, CompLearn
	forms an attractive offering in machine-learning frameworks and
	toolkits.

	 Elefant (Efficient Learning, Large-scale Inference, and Optimisation
	 Toolkit) is an open source library for machine learning licensed under
	 the Mozilla Public License (MPL). We develop an open source machine
	 learning toolkit which provides

        <itemize>
	  <item>algorithms for machine learning utilising the power of
	  multi-core/multi-threaded processors/operating systems (Linux,
	  WIndows, Mac OS X),
	  <item>a graphical user interface for users who want to quickly
	  prototype machine learning experiments,
	  <item>tutorials to support learning about Statistical Machine
	  Learning (Statistical Machine Learning at The Australian National
	  University), and
	  <item>detailed and precise documentation for each of the above.

        </itemize>

	The Maximum Entropy Toolkit provides a set of tools and library for
	constructing maximum entropy (maxent) model in either Python or C++.

	Maxent Entropy Model is a general purpose machine learning framework
	that has proved to be highly expressive and powerful in statistical
	natural language processing, statistical physics, computer vision and
	many other fields.

                url="http://code.google.com/p/peach/">
        </itemize>

	Peach is a pure-python module, based on SciPy and NumPy to implement
	algorithms for computational intelligence and machine learning. Methods
	implemented include, but are not limited to, artificial neural
	networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence and much
	more.

	The aim of this library is primarily educational. Nonetheless, care was
	taken to make the methods implemented also very efficient.

        Pebl is a python library and command line application for learning the
        structure of a Bayesian network given prior knowledge and observations.
        Pebl includes the following features:

        <itemize>
          <item>Can learn with observational and interventional data
	  <item>Handles missing values and hidden variables using exact and
	  heuristic methods
	  <item>Provides several learning algorithms; makes creating new ones
	  simple
	  <item>Has facilities for transparent parallel execution using several
	  cluster/grid resources
          <item>Calculates edge marginals and consensus networks
          <item>Presents results in a variety of formats 
        </itemize>

	PyBrain is a modular Machine Learning Library for Python. It's goal is
	to offer flexible, easy-to-use yet still powerful algorithms for
	Machine Learning Tasks and a variety of predefined environments to test
	and compare your algorithms.

	PyBrain contains algorithms for neural networks, for reinforcement
	learning (and the combination of the two), for unsupervised learning,
	and evolution. Since most of the current problems deal with continuous
	state and action spaces, function approximators (like neural networks)
	must be used to cope with the large dimensionality. Our library is
	built around neural networks in the kernel and all of the training
	methods accept a neural network as the to-be-trained instance. This
	makes PyBrain a powerful tool for real-life tasks.

       	Not a library per-say, but a whole slew of example machine learning
        algorithms from the book "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective"
        by Stephen Marsland.  All code is written in python.

  systems oriented toward general learning (i.e., no spam filters and the
  like).

        The dbacl project consist of a set of lightweight UNIX/POSIX utilities
        which can be used, either directly or in shell scripts, to classify
        text documents automatically, according to Bayesian statistical
        principles.

      All about getting machines to learn to do something rather than 
      explicitly programming to do it. Tends to deal with pattern matching
      a lot and are heavily math and statistically based. Technically 
      <ref id="Connectionism"> falls under this category, but it is such a
      large sub-field I'm keeping it in a separate section.


  <sect1>Libraries

  Libraries or frameworks used for writing machine learning systems.

	CompLearn is a software system built to support compression-based
	learning in a wide variety of applications. It provides this support in
	the form of a library written in highly portable ANSI C that runs in
	most modern computer environments with minimal confusion. It also
	supplies a small suite of simple, composable command-line utilities as
	simple applications that use this library. Together with other commonly
	used machine-learning tools such as LibSVM and GraphViz, CompLearn
	forms an attractive offering in machine-learning frameworks and
	toolkits.

	The Maximum Entropy Toolkit provides a set of tools and library for
	constructing maximum entropy (maxent) model in either Python or C++.

	Maxent Entropy Model is a general purpose machine learning framework
	that has proved to be highly expressive and powerful in statistical
	natural language processing, statistical physics, computer vision and
	many other fields.

        </itemize>

        Pebl is a python library and command line application for learning the
        structure of a Bayesian network given prior knowledge and observations.
        Pebl includes the following features:

        <itemize>
          <item>Can learn with observational and interventional data
	  <item>Handles missing values and hidden variables using exact and
	  heuristic methods
	  <item>Provides several learning algorithms; makes creating new ones
	  simple
	  <item>Has facilities for transparent parallel execution using several
	  cluster/grid resources
          <item>Calculates edge marginals and consensus networks
          <item>Presents results in a variety of formats 
        </itemize>

        </itemize>

       	Not a library per-say, but a whole slew of example machine learning
        algorithms from the book "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective"
        by Stephen Marsland.  All code is written in python.

  <sect1>Applications
  <p>

  Full applications that implement various machine learning or statistical
  systems oriented toward general learning (i.e., no spam filters and the
  like).

        The dbacl project consist of a set of lightweight UNIX/POSIX utilities
        which can be used, either directly or in shell scripts, to classify
        text documents automatically, according to Bayesian statistical
        principles.
